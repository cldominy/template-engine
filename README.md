# Template Engine Application

This template engine was built using Object Oriented Programing so that a user an endlesssly add employees onto a team array with minimal, reusable coding. Node.js and inquirer help users create a team roaster through the terminal, asking specific questions based on the employee's role. Once finished, the html document is rendered and created through the output. Future considerations for this project is to limit the amount of managers, verify what the user inputted, and changing the CSS for the html page.
